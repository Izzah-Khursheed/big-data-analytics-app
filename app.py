            ### Classification Algorithms
            - **SVM (Support Vector Machines):**  
              A powerful algorithm that finds the best boundary (hyperplane) to separate classes by maximizing the margin between data points of different classes. Works well for small to medium-sized datasets and supports linear and non-linear classification using kernels.
            - **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors):**  
              A simple, instance-based learning method that classifies a data point based on the majority class of its K closest neighbors in the feature space. No training phase; useful for small datasets.
            - **Decision Tree:**  
              A tree-structured model where each node splits the data based on feature thresholds, leading to easy-to-interpret rules. Prone to overfitting but fast and intuitive.
            - **Logistic Regression:**  
              A linear model used for binary classification that estimates probabilities using the logistic (sigmoid) function. Effective for linearly separable classes.
            - **Naive Bayes:**  
              A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem assuming feature independence. Very fast and performs well on high-dimensional data, especially text classification.
            - **Random Forest:**  
              An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees on random subsets of data and features, then aggregates their results for better accuracy and robustness against overfitting.

            ### Regression Algorithms
            - **Linear Regression:**  
              A fundamental algorithm to predict continuous target variables by fitting a linear relationship between input features and the output. Minimizes the sum of squared errors.
            - **KNN Regressor:**  
              Extension of KNN for regression tasks; predicts the target by averaging the values of the K nearest neighbors. Non-parametric and simple but sensitive to noisy data.
            - **Decision Tree Regressor:**  
              Uses tree-based splits to model non-linear relationships by dividing the feature space into regions with similar output values. Easy to visualize and interpret.
